    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p><span class="sc">Prince Albert Joachim</span>, it appears,
    did not take part in the attack on a French officer at the
    Hotel Adlon, but only gave the signal. Always the little
    Hohenzollern!</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It seems that at the last moment Mr. <span class="sc">C. B.
    Cochran</span> broke off negotiations for the exclusive right
    to organise the <span class="sc">Carpentier</span> wedding.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Will Scotland go dry?" asks <i>The Daily Express</i>. Not
    on purpose, we imagine.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A new method of stopping an omnibus by a foot-lever has been
    patented. This is much better than the old plan of shaking
    one's umbrella at them.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>, we read, makes a
    study of handwriting. The only objection that <i>The Times</i>
    has to this habit is that he positively refuses to notice the
    writing on the wall.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is rumoured that the Government will construct an
    experimental tunnel between England and the United States in
    order (1) to cement Anglo-American friendship, and (2) to
    ascertain if the Channel Tunnel is practicable.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Dr. <span class="sc">C.W. Colby</span>, head of the
    Department of History, has taken Sir <span class="sc">Aucland
    Geddes'</span> place as Principal of McGill University. The
    report that Sir <span class="sc">Auckland</span> will
    reciprocate by taking a place in history awaits
    confirmation.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"It is quite usual nowadays," a well-known auctioneer
    states, "for mill hands to keep a few orchids." We understand
    that by way of a counter-stroke a number of noblemen are
    threatening to go in for runner ducks.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Rotherham couple who have just celebrated their diamond
    wedding have never tasted medicine. We ourselves have always
    maintained that the taste is an acquired one.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Greenland falcon has been shot in the Orkneys. The view is
    widely taken that the wretched bird, which must have known it
    wasn't in Greenland, brought the trouble on itself.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>An alleged anarchist arrested in Munich was identified as a
    poet and found Not Guilty&mdash;not guilty, that is to say, of
    being an anarchist.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>With reference to the pending retirement of Mr.
          <span class="sc">Robert Smillie</span> from the
          Presidency of the Miners' Federation, it appears that
          there is talk of arranging a farewell strike.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The <i>Berlin Vorwaerts</i> states that ex-Emperor
    <span class="sc">Carl</span> has been discovered in Hungary
    under an assumed name. The Hungarian authorities say that
    unless he is claimed within three days he will be sold to
    defray expenses.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We understand that Mr. Justice <span class=
    "sc">Darling's</span> weekly denial of the reports of his
    retirement will in future be issued on Tuesdays, instead of
    Wednesdays, as hitherto.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>When hit by a bullet a tiger roars until dead, says a weekly
    paper, but a tigress dies quietly. Nervous people who suffer
    from headaches should therefore only shoot tigresses.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Two out of ten houses being built at Guildford are now
    complete. Builders in other parts of the country are asking who
    gave the word "Go."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Marvellous to relate," says a Sunday paper, "a horse has
    just died at Ingatestone at the age of thirty-six." Surely it
    is more marvellous that it did not die before.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is said that the Paris Peace Conference cost two million
    pounds. The latest suggestion is that, before the next war
    starts, tenders for a Peace Conference shall be asked for and
    the lowest estimate accepted.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Walsall carter has summoned a fellow-worker because during
    a quarrel he stepped on his face. It was not so much that he
    had stepped on his face, we understand, as the fact that he had
    loitered about on it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A painful mistake is reported from North London. It appears
    that a young lady who went to a fancy-dress ball as "The Silent
    Wife" was awarded the first prize for her clever impersonation
    of a telephone girl.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We are glad to learn that the thoughtless tradesman who, in
    spite of the notice, "Please ring the bell," deliberately
    knocked at the front-door of a wooden house, has now had to pay
    the full cost of rebuilding.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>After reading in her morning paper that bumping races were
    held recently at Cambridge, a dear old lady expressed sorrow
    that the disgraceful scenes witnessed in many dance-rooms in
    London had spread to one of our older universities.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Tyrolese hats have reappeared in London after an interval of
    nearly five years. We understand that the yodel waistcoat will
    also be heard this spring.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Welshman was fined fifteen pounds last week for fishing
    for salmon with a lamp. Defendant's plea, that he was merely
    investigating the scientific question of whether salmon yawn in
    their sleep, was not accepted.</p>

    <h2>FAIR WEAR AND TEAR.</h2>

    <p>In a short time now we shall have to return this flat to its
    proper tenants and arrive at some assessment of the damage done
    to their effects. With regard to the other rooms, even the room
    which Richard and Priscilla condescend to use as a nursery, I
    shall accept the owners' estimate cheerfully enough, I think;
    but the case of the drawing-room furniture is different. About
    the nursery I have only heard vague rumours, but in the
    drawing-room I have been an eye-witness of the facts.</p>

    <p>The proper tenant is a bachelor who lived here with his
    sister; he will scarcely realise, therefore, what happens at 5
    P.M. every day, when there comes, as the satiric poet,
    <span class="sc">Longfellow</span>, has so finely
    sung&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"A pause in the day's occupations,</p>

            <p>Which is known as the children's hour."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Drawing-room furniture indeed! When one considers the
    buildings and munition dumps, the live and rolling stock, the
    jungles and forests in that half-charted territory; when one
    considers that even the mere wastepaper basket by the
    writing-desk (and it <i>does</i> look a bit battered, that
    wastepaper basket) is sometimes the tin helmet under which
    Richard defies the frightfulness of <span class="sc">Lars
    Porsena</span>, and sometimes a necessary stage property for
    Priscilla's two favourite dramatic recitations</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"He plunged with a delighted <i>scweam</i></p>

            <p>Into a bowl of clotted cweam,"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"This is Mr. Piggy Wee,</p>

            <p class="i2">With tail so pink and curly,</p>

            <p>And when I say, 'Good mornin', pig,'</p>

            <p class="i2">He answers <i>vewwy</i> surly,</p>

            <p class="i10">Oomph! Oomph!'"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and sometimes the hutch that harbours a cotton-wool creation
    supposed to be a white rabbit, and stated by the owner to be
    "munsin' and munsin' and munsin' a carrot"&mdash;when, I say, I
    consider all these things I anticipate that the proceedings of
    the Reparation Commission will be something like
    this:&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>He (looking a little ruefully at the round
    music-stool)</i>. I suppose your wife plays the piano a good
    deal?</p>

    <p><i>I (brightly)</i>. If you mean the detachable
    steering-wheel, it is only fair to remember that a part
    interchangeable between the motor-omnibus and the
    steam-roller&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>He</i>. I don't understand.</p>

    <p><i>I</i>. Permit me to reassemble the mechanism.</p>

    <p><i>He</i>. You mean that when you put that armchair at the
    end of the sofa and the music-stool in front of it&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>I</i>. I mean that the motor-omnibus driver, sitting as
    he does in front of his vehicle and manipulating his
    steering-wheel like this, can do little or no harm to the
    apparatus. On the other hand, the steam-roller mechanic,
    standing <i>inside</i> the body of the vehicle, and having the
    steering-wheel in <i>this</i> position&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>He</i>. On the sofa?</p>

    <p><i>I</i>. Naturally. Well, supposing he happens to have a
    slight difference of opinion with his mate as to which of them
    ought to do the driving, the wheel is quite likely to be pushed
    off on to the macadam, where it gets a trifle frayed round the
    edges.</p>

    <p><i>He</i>. I see. How awfully stupid of me! And this pouffe,
    or whatever they call it?</p>

    <p><i>I</i>. Week in and week out, boy and girl, I have seen
    that dromedary ridden over more miles of desert than I can tell
    you, and never once have I known it under-fed or under-watered,
    or struck with anything harder than the human fist. Of course
    the hump does get a little floppy with frequent use, but
    considering how barren your Sahara&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>He</i>. Quite, quite. I was just looking at that
    armchair. Aren't there a lot of scratches on the legs?</p>

    <p><i>I</i>. Have you ever <i>kept</i> panthers? Do you realise
    how impatiently they chafe at times against the bars of their
    cage? Of course, if you haven't....</p>

    <p>Finally, I imagine he will see how reasonable my attitude is
    and how little he has to complain of. He will recognise that
    one cannot deal with complicated properties of this sort
    without a certain amount of inevitable dilapidation and
    loss.</p>

    <p>As a matter of fact I have an even stronger line of argument
    if I choose to take it. I can put in a counter-claim. One of
    the principal attractions of old furniture, after all, is
    historic association. There is the armchair, you know, that Dr.
    <span class="sc">Johnson</span> sat in, and the inkpot, or
    whatever it was, that <span class="sc">Mary</span>, Queen of
    Scots, threw at <span class="sc">John Bunyan</span> or
    somebody, and I have also seen garden-seats carved out of
    famous battleships. And then again, if you go to Euston, or it
    may be Darlington, you will find on the platform the original
    tea-kettle out of which <span class="sc">George
    Washington</span> constructed the first steam-engine. The
    drawing-room furniture that we are relinquishing combines the
    interest of all these things. If I like I can put a placard on
    the sofa, before I take its owner to see it, worded something
    like this:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Puffing Billy, the original steam-roller out of which this
    elegant piece was carved, held the 1920 record for fourteen
    trips to Brighton and back within half-an-hour." And after he
    has seen that I can lead him gently on to Roaring Rupert, the
    arm-chair. Really, therefore, when one comes to consider it,
    the man owes me a considerable sum of money for the enhanced
    sentimental value that has been given to his commonplace
    property.</p>

    <p>Mind you, I have no wish to be too hard on him. I shall be
    content with a quite moderate claim, or even with no claim at
    all. Possibly, now I come to think of it; I shall simply
    say,</p>

    <p>"You know what it is to have a couple of bally kids about
    the place. What shall I give you to call it square?"</p>

    <p>And he will name a sum and offer me a cigarette, and we
    shall talk a little about putting or politics.</p>

    <p>But it doesn't much matter. Whatever he asks he can only put
    it down in the receipts' column of his account-book under the
    heading of "Depreciation of Furniture," whereas in my expenses
    it will stand as "Richard and Priscilla: for Adventures, Travel
    and Romance."</p>

    <h2>WINTER SPORT IN THE LOWER ALPS.</h2>

    <p>About two months ago, after a course of travel literature
    and some back numbers of <i>The Badminton Magazine</i>, I
    became infected with a desire to spend a winter in the Alps,
    skating, sliding, curling and yodelling in the intervals of
    ski-ing, skijoring, skilacking and skihandlung. The very names
    of the pastimes conjured up a picture of swift and healthy
    activity. As the pamphlets assured me, I should return a new
    man; and, though I am greatly attached to the old one, I
    recognised that improvement was possible.</p>

    <p>I don't remember how it came about that I finally chose
    Freidegg among the multiplicity of winter-sport stations whose
    descriptions approximated to those of Heaven. I expect
    Frederick forced the choice upon me; Frederick had been to
    Switzerland every winter from 1906 to 1913 and knew the ropes.
    I somehow gathered that the ropes were of unusual
    complexity.</p>

    <p>The entire journey was passed among winter-sporters of a
    certain type. From their conversation I was able to learn that
    Badeloden was formerly overrun by Germans; that Franzheim was
    excellent if you stayed at the Grand, but at the Kurhaus the
    guests were unsociable, while at the Oberalp you were not done
    well and the central-heating was inefficient.</p>

    <p>I ventured a few questions about the sport available, but
    was gently rebuked by the silence which followed before
    conversation was resumed in a further discussion of comforts
    and social amenities.</p>

    <p>On arrival at the hotel I took out my skates, but, on
    Frederick's advice, hid them again. "Don't let people see that
    you are a newcomer; there won't be any skating for some weeks
    yet," said he.</p>

    <p>"But why not?" I objected. "The ice must be at least six
    inches thick."</p>

    <p>"Well, it isn't done," he replied. "One's first week is
    spent in settling down; you can't go straight on the ice
    without preparation."</p>

    <p>On the third day a Sports' Meeting was held, as the result
    of which a programme of the season was published. It was
    announced that there would be, weekly, three dances and one
    bridge tournament; a theatrical performance would be given once
    a fortnight, and the blank evenings filled with either a
    concert or an entertainment. I began to wonder how I could
    squeeze in time for sleep.</p>

    <p>In order that boredom might not overtake the guests before
    evening came, a magnificent tea was served from four to six.
    During the afternoon one could visit the other hotels of the
    place and usually found some function in progress. We were not
    expected to breakfast before ten, and the short time that
    remained before lunch was spent in a walk to the rink, where we
    would solemnly take a few steps on the ice, murmur, "Not in
    condition yet," and return to the hotel.</p>

    <p>After about a fortnight of this I announced to Frederick
    that I was going to skate, no matter how far from perfection
    the ice proved to be.</p>

    <p>Frederick was indignant.</p>

    <p>"You'll make yourself both conspicuous and unpopular. The
    two Marriotts are giving an exhibition to-morrow; if you spoil
    the ice for them their show will be ruined."</p>

    <p>"Very well, then," said I, "I will borrow some ski and mess
    about on the snow."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205"
       id="page205"></a>[pg 205]</span>

    <p>"You can't do that," he replied, horrified; "the
    professionals are coming next week for the open competition,
    and if they don't find clean snow&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"All right; I'll get one of those grid-irons and course down
    the ice-run. I suppose that's what the ice-run is for," said I
    bitterly.</p>

    <p>"And spoil the Alpine Derby, which you know is fixed for the
    tenth?" Frederick addressed me with some severity. "Look
    here&mdash;you must choose your sport and stick to it. I am a
    ski-er; you don't find me skating or bobbing or curling."</p>

    <p>"Or ski-ing," I added.</p>

    <p>"Before ski-ing," he informed me, "one must have one's ski
    in perfect condition. Mine are improving daily."</p>

    <p>Frederick in fact spent his short mornings in giving
    instructions as to how his ski were to be oiled and rubbed. All
    the most complicated operations of unction and massage were
    performed upon them, and all the time Frederick watched over
    them as over a sick child.</p>

    <p>Next I was told that the height of the season had arrived.
    The round of indoor entertainments went on and almost daily the
    guests walked to some near point to witness performances by
    professionals who seemed to tour the country for that
    purpose.</p>

    <p>Just when there appeared to be a slight prospect of some
    general outdoor activity (and Frederick's ski were pronounced
    perfect) a thaw occurred. I am bound to say that the event was
    received philosophically. Not a single member of the company
    made any complaint; they faced adversity like true Britons and
    boldly sat in the warm hotel to save themselves for the
    evening. Nor did their distress put them off their feed; they
    punished the tea unmercifully, showing scarcely a sign of the
    aching sorrow which devoured them.</p>

    <p>Soon it froze again. The daily visit to the ice was made and
    Frederick's ski were once more put into training.</p>

    <p>As for me I began to believe that there was something
    shameful or disgraceful in my desire to skate. So I left
    secretly for Sicily. Here I can enjoy passive entertainment
    without being unpleasantly chilled.</p>

    <p>Well, a few days ago I received from Frederick a letter,
    from which the following is a quotation: "The final thaw has
    now occurred and the season is ended. It has been one of the
    most successful on record. The full programme was carried out
    to the letter; I wish you had been here for the last Fancy
    Dress. My ski were really fit and I was looking forward to some
    great days on the snow. I think I made a bit of a hit too,
    playing <i>Lord Twinkles</i> in <i>The Gay Life</i>."</p>

    <p>The ski will no doubt miss Frederick's affectionate
    attention; he was very fond of them.</p>

    <p>Yesterday, by the purest accident I came across Claudia,
    like myself enjoying the warmth and sunshine.</p>

    <p>"Oh, you've been to Freidegg; how lovely! I went to Kestaag
    this year and was very glad to leave. Nothing to do in the
    evening but sit round a fire. All day the hotel was like a
    wilderness and outside nothing but a lot of men falling about
    in the snow. They were too tired to do anything during the
    evening. It was horrid. Next time I shall be more careful and
    choose a nice bright place like Freidegg."</p>

    <p>Next time I too shall be more careful.</p>

    <h2>HOUND-FOXES.</h2>

    <p>It was really Isabel's idea. But it must be admitted that
    the Foxes took it up with remarkable promptitude. How it
    reached them is uncertain, but maybe the little bird that nests
    outside her nursery window knows more than we do.</p>

    <p>The idea owed its inception to my attempt at explaining the
    pink-coated horsemen depicted on an old Christmas card. I did
    my best, right up to and including the "worry," in which Isabel
    joined with enthusiasm. Then she went to bed.</p>

    <p>But not to sleep. As I passed by the open door I heard a
    small excited voice expounding to a lymphatic dolly the whole
    mystery of fox-hunting:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"And there was a wood, and there was a smell. And all the
    peoploos on '<i>normous</i> huge high horses. And <i>nen</i>
    all the hound-foxes runned after the smell and eated it all
    up."</p>

    <p>A fortnight later, taking a short cut through the Squire's
    coverts, I sat down to enjoy the glory of woodland springtime.
    "There was a wood and there was a smell." There certainly was;
    in fact I was all but sitting upon an earth.</p>

    <p>All this is credible enough. Now I hope you will believe the
    rest of the story.</p>

    <p>A dirty sheet of paper lay near Reynard's front doorstep.
    Idly curious, I picked it up. Strange paper, a form of print
    that I had never seen before; marked too with dirty pads.</p>

    <p>It was a newspaper of sorts. Prominent notices adjured the
    reader to "Write to <i>John Fox</i> about it." The leading
    article was headed</p>

    <p class="center">"AN APPEAL."</p>

    <p>"Foxes of Britain!" it began; "opposed though we have always
    been to revolutionary politics, a clear line is indicated to us
    out of the throes of the Re-birth. The old feudal relations
    between Foxes and Men have had their day. The England that has
    been the paradise of the wealthy, of the pink-coated, of the
    doubly second-horsed, must become that of the oppressed, the
    hunted, the hand-to-mouth liver. In a word, we have had enough
    of Fox-Hounds; henceforth we will have Hound-Foxes."</p>

    <p>Then the policy was outlined. Foxes could not hunt
    hounds&mdash;no; but they could lead them a dog's life. They
    had been in the past too sporting; thought too little of their
    own safety, too much of the pleasure of the Hunt and of the
    reputation of its country.</p>

    <p>Henceforth the League of Hound-Foxes would dispense justice
    to the oppressors. No more forty-minute bursts over the best
    line in the country; no more grass and easy fences; no more
    favourable crossing points at the Whissendine Brook; no more
    rhapsodies in <i>The Field</i> over "a game and gallant
    fox."</p>

    <p>A Hound-Fox would be game, but not gallant. He would carry
    with him a large-scale specially-marked map, showing where
    bullfinches were unstormable; where the only gaps harboured on
    the far side a slimy ditch; where woods were rideless; where
    wire was unmarked; where railways lured to
    destruction&mdash;over and through each and every point would
    the Hound-Fox entice the cursing Hunt.</p>

    <p>As for the Hounds, they feared no obstacles, but they hated
    mockery. <i>They</i> should be led on to the premises of
    sausage factories; through villages, to be greeted as
    brothers-in-the-chase by forty yelping curs; into
    infant-schools (that old joke), where the delighted babes would
    throw arms around their necks and call them "Doggie," until
    both men and hounds would begin to question whether the game
    were worth the candle.</p>

    <p>Therefore let every eligible vulpine enroll himself to-day
    as a Hound-Fox. They must be dog-foxes, rising three or over,
    of good stamina, with plenty of scent, intelligent and
    preferably unmarried. The League Secretary was &mdash;&mdash;
    (here followed the name, earth and covert of a well-known
    veteran).</p>

    <p>There was other matter, of course. A "Grand Prize
    Competition&mdash;A Turkey a Week for Life!" was announced. A
    humorous article on Earth-Stoppers and, on the "Vixens' Page,"
    a discussion as to the edibility of Pekinese.</p>

    <p>Absent-mindedly I crumpled up the astounding rag and thrust
    it down the hole.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I arose stiff, bemused. The hot March sunshine and the song
    of birds had left me drowsy. A glance at my watch showed me, to
    my astonishment, that was tea-time. So I made my way home.</p>

    <p>The reception of my story was as cold as the tea. They
    weren't such fools, they said, as to believe it. So, knowing
    your larger charity, dear Mr. Punch, I send it to you.</p>

    <p>And I shall await that retrospective article in some Maytime
    <i>Field</i>, entitled "A Season of Disasters."</p>

    <p>The appearance of the Dean of <span class="sc">St.
    Paul's</span> at a recent social gathering not in the character
    of a wet blanket, but as a teller of jocund tales and a
    retailer of humorous anecdotes, must not be taken as an
    isolated and transient transformation, but as foreshadowing a
    general conversion of writers and publicists hitherto
    associated with utterances of a mordant, bitter, sardonic and
    pessimistic tone.</p>

    <p>It is rumoured at Cambridge that Mr. <span class=
    "sc">Maynard Keynes</span>, mollified by the reception of his
    momentous work, has plunged into an orgy of optimism, the
    first-fruits of which will be a treatise on <i>The Gastronomic
    Consequences of the Peace</i>. Those who have been fortunate
    enough to see the MS. declare that the personal sketches of Mr.
    <span class="sc">Clynes</span>, Mr. G.H. <span class=
    "sc">Roberts</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">Hoover</span> and M.
    <span class="sc">Escoffier</span> are marked by a coruscating
    wit unparalleled in the annals of Dietetics. The account of a
    dinner at the "White Horse" is perhaps the <i>clou</i> of an
    exceptionally exhilarating entertainment.</p>

    <p>This agreeable swing of the pendulum is further illustrated
    by the report that Mr. <span class="sc">Philip Gibbs</span>, by
    way of counteracting the depression caused by his last book, is
    contemplating a palliative under the title of <i>Humours of the
    Home Front</i>. It is hoped that the book will come out
    serially in the pages of <i>The Hibbert Journal</i>.</p>

    <p>Very welcome too is the report, not yet officially
    confirmed, that Sir E. <span class="sc">Ray Lankester</span> is
    engaged on a genial biography of Sir <span class="sc">Arthur
    Conan Doyle</span>, with special reference to his achievements
    in the domain of psychical research.</p>

    <p>Other similar rumours are flying about in Fleet Street, but
    we give them with necessary reserve. One of them credits Mr.
    <span class="sc">Lytton Strachey</span> with the resolve to
    indite a panegyric of the Archbishop of <span class=

    <h2>THE BOAT-RACE AGAIN.</h2>

    <p>In June, 1914, I took a house on the Thames, in order to
    make sure of a good view of the Boat-Race; then a man threw a
    bomb at Serajevo and ruined my plans. But now it is going to
    happen again. And instead of fighting with a vast crowd at
    Hammersmith Bridge I shall simply walk up into the bathroom and
    look out of the window. It is wonderful.</p>

    <p>Yet meanwhile I have lost some of my illusions about this
    race. I have a boat myself; I myself have rowed all over the
    course in my boat. It is only ten feet long, but it is very,
    very heavy. Still, I have rowed in it all over the
    course&mdash;with ease. Yet people talk as if it was a
    marvellous thing for eight men to row a light boat over the
    same water. Why is that? It is because the ignorant land-lubber
    regards the river Thames as a pond; or else he regards it as a
    river flowing always to the sea. He forgets about the tide. The
    Boat-Race is rowed <i>with the tide</i>; they deliberately
    choose a moment when the tide is coming in, and hope nobody
    will notice; and nobody does notice. The tide runs about three
    miles an hour, sometimes more; if they just sat still in the
    boat they would reach Mortlake eventually, and the crowd would
    get a good look at them, instead of seeing them for ten
    seconds. The race ought to be rowed <i>against</i> the tide.
    Then it really would be a feat of strength; then it really
    would take ten years off their lives&mdash;perhaps more. Then
    perhaps small boys would drop things on them from the bridges,
    as they do on me. I wonder they don't try to do that now. There
    is a certain quiet satisfaction in dropping things on people,
    especially if they are labouring under Hammersmith Bridge
    against the tide, and I should imagine that the temptation to
    drop things on a University crew would be almost irresistible.
    It is not everyone who can look back and say, "In 1890 I hit
    the Oxford stroke in the stomach with a stone." As it is,
    though, I suppose they go too fast for that kind of thing.</p>

    <p>But apart from the small boys on the bridges, the present
    system is most unsatisfactory for people who know "a man in the
    boat." Even in a football match it is possible for an aunt
    occasionally to distinguish her nephew and say, "Look, there is
    Edward." But if she says, "Look, there is Edward," meaning No.
    5 in the Cambridge boat, you know she is imagining. All she
    sees is a vague splashing between two bowler-hats, or possibly
    the Oxford rudder moving at high speed through a horse's legs.
    If the race were rowed against the tide we should all get our
    money's worth; and the oars-men could then put more realism
    into their "After-the-Finish" attitudes. As it is, they roll
    about in the boat with a praiseworthy suggestion of fatigue,
    but nobody really believes they are tired&mdash;nobody at least
    who has rowed on the Thames with the tide.</p>

    <p>No, I am afraid the actual race is a sad hypocrisy. But the
    training must be terrible. Think of it. They started practising
    in the second week in January: they row the race in the fourth
    week in March. For ten weeks and more they have been "getting
    those hands away" and driving with those legs and not
    washing-out. For ten weeks horrible men with huge calves have
    shouted at them and cursed them and told them their sins, like
    a monk telling his beads&mdash;"Bow, you're late; Two, you're
    early; Three, you're bucketing; Four, you're not bucketing
    enough." I listen painfully, hoping against hope that at least
    one of the crew may be left out of the catalogue, that Stroke
    at least may be rowing properly. But no, Stroke is not
    forgotten, and even Cox doesn't always give complete
    satisfaction.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I feel that I ought to <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="page209"
       id="page209"></a>[pg 209]</span> row out in my little boat
       and offer to tow the incompetents back to Putney. Yet they
       seem somehow to travel very easily and well. But, however
       harmoniously they swing past "The Doves" or quicken to
       thirty-five at Chiswick Eyot, I know that in their hearts
       they are hating each other. Goodness, how they must hate
       each other! For ten weeks they have been rowing together in
       the same boring boat, behind the same boring back. I read
       with grim interest about the periodical shiftings of the
       crew, how Stroke has moved to the Bow thwart, and Bow has
       replaced Number Three, and Number Three has shifted to the
       Stroke position. They may pretend that all this is a
       scientific matter of adjustment, of balance and weight and
       so forth. I know better. I know that Stroke is fed up with
       the face of Cox, and that the mole on Number Two's neck has
       got thoroughly on Bow's nerves, and that if Number Three has
       to sit any longer behind Number Four's expanse of back he
       will go mad. That is the secret of it all. But I suppose
       they each of them hate the coach, and that keeps them
       together.</p>

    <p>Of all these sufferers perhaps Cox is most to be pitied.
    They all have to eat what they're told, no doubt, yards and
    yards of beefsteak, and so on. In the old days rowing men had
    to drink beer at breakfast; I can't think of anything worse,
    except, perhaps, stout. But Cox doesn't eat anything at all. He
    has to get thinner and thinner. And if there is one thing
    worse, than eating beefsteak at breakfast it must be watching
    eight rowing men eating beefsteak at breakfast and not eating
    anything yourself.</p>

    <p>Yes, beyond question Cox is the real hero. I watch him
    dwindling, day by day, from nine stone to eight stone, from
    eight stone to seven stone twelve, and my heart goes out to the
    little fellow. And what a job it is! If anything goes wrong,
    Cox did it. He kept too far out or he kept too far in, or too
    much in the middle. But who ever heard of Cox doing a brilliant
    piece of steering, or saving the situation, or even rising to
    the occasion? His highest ambition is for <i>The Times</i> to
    say that he did his work "adequately"&mdash;like the <i>Second
    Murderer</i> in <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>.</p>

    <p>And at the finish he can't even pretend that he's tired,
    like the other men; even if there was any spectacular way of
    showing that he was half-frozen he couldn't do it, because he
    alone is responsible if one of the steamers runs over them and
    they are all drowned. We ought to take off our hats to Cox;
    though, of course, if we did, Stroke would think it was
    intended for him.</p>

    <p>But indeed I take off my hat to all of them; not because of
    the race, which, as I say, is a piece of hypocrisy, being rowed
    with the tide, but because of the terrible preparation for the
    race. I wonder if it is worth it. It is true that they have
    lady adorers on the towing-path at Putney, and it is even
    rumoured that they receive anonymous presents of chocolates.
    But presumably they are not allowed to eat them, so that these
    can do little to alleviate their sufferings. It is true also
    that for ever after (if their wives allow it) they can hang an
    enormous oar on the wall and contemplate it after dinner. But,
    after all, I can do that too, if I like; for I too have rowed
    over the course.</p>

    <p>And <i>I</i> shall have a free view of the race. But none of
    them will see it at all. They will all be looking at the back
    of the man in front, except Stroke, whose eye will be riveted
    on the second button of Cox's blazer. What a life!</p>

    <p><i>Monday, March 8th</i>.&mdash;I should hesitate to call

    of the Ministry, though he has something of that worthy's
    sublime self-confidence and his capacity for taking any number
    of posts. The House, which knows him both as Under-Secretary
    for Foreign Affairs and Secretary to the Overseas Trade
    Department of the Board of Trade, was surprised to hear him
    answering questions relating to the nascent oil-wells in the
    United Kingdom, and to learn that he had become "Minister for
    Petroleum Affairs." But there the likeness ceases to be exact.
    <i>Pooh Bah's</i> interest was in palm-oil.</p>

    <p>A few days ago the <span class="sc">Chancellor of the
    Exchequer</span> facetiously compared the critics of the
    Government to the poet of <i>Rejected Addresses</i> who
    declared that it was <span class="sc">Buonaparte</span> "who
    makes the quartern loaf and Luddites rise." Out of the
    Government's own mouth the critics are now, at any rate,
    partially justified, for the <span class="sc">Prime
    Minister</span> announced that the bread subsidy was to be
    halved, and that on and after April 12th the quartern loaf
    would rise&mdash;he did not quite know where.</p>

    <p>In view of the occasional rumours of friction between
    Government departments it is pleasant to record that the
    Ministry of Transport and the War Office are on the friendliest
    terms. Invited to abolish, in the interests of the taxpayer,
    the cheap railway tickets now issued to soldiers, Mr.
    <span class="sc">Neal</span> said it was primarily a question
    for the War Office, as in this matter Sir <span class="sc">Eric
    Geddes</span> would wish to move in harmony with Mr.
    <span class="sc">Churchill</span>. As the <span class="sc">War
    Secretary</span> promptly announced his intention of doing his
    best to maintain the soldiers' privilege it is conjectured that
    he will return from the ride with Sir <span class=
    "sc">Eric</span> inside.</p>

    <p>The new Member for Paisley delivered his maiden speech
    to-night, and acquitted himself so well that in the opinion of
    Members many months his senior he is likely to go far. The
    Government had proposed to "guillotine" the remaining
    Supplementary Estimates in order to get them through before
    March 31st. Some ardent economists, mainly drawn from the
    Coalition, while ready to concede the end, protested against
    the means, and proposed that the House should make its own
    arrangements.</p>

    <p>Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span> promptly perceived the
    advantage of transferring from the Government to the House a
    disagreeable responsibility. Forgetting that he was cast for
    the executioner, not the hero, he murmured, "It is a far, far
    better thing," and graciously accepted the proposed
    alternative. Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>, not unwilling
    to help in establishing a precedent which some day he himself
    may find useful, backed him up, and the House, as a whole,
    congratulating itself on its escape from the public
    executioner, cheerfully proceeded to commit
    <i>harakiri</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, March 9th</i>.&mdash;Mr. <span class=
    "sc">Shortt</span> relieved our apprehensions by stating that
    the few spurious "Bradburys" in circulation are of home
    manufacture, and that, while a few specimens emanating from
    Russia had been sent here for identification, they were so
    poorly executed that they would scarcely pass muster in this
    country. It is comforting to think that there is one British
    industry which has nothing to fear from foreign dumping, but is
    cheerfully forging ahead.</p>

    <p>The <span class="sc">Home Secretary</span> also denied that
    there had been any remarkable increase in pocket-picking or
    that schools existed for the training of young criminals. As
    Sir <span class="sc">Maurice Dockrell</span> pointed out, there
    is indeed no need for them so long as the cinemas provide their
    present facilities. <i>Fagin</i> has been quite knocked out by
    the film.</p>

    <p>The Parliamentary vocabulary extends apace. Mr.
          <span class="sc">Rendall</span>, whose motion on divorce
          had been postponed under the new arrangements for
          business until after Easter, complained that Sir
          <span class="sc">Frederick Banbury</span> had "done him
          down."</p>

    <p>Part of the evening was devoted to the bread-subsidy. The
    debate incidentally illustrated the intellectual independence
    of Ministers. A few days ago Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd
    George</span>, in advocating the resumption of trade with
    Russia, declared that "the corn-bins of Russia were bulging
    with grain." To-night Mr. <span class="sc">McCurdy</span> told
    the House that, according to his information, the resumption of
    trade <span class="pagenum"><a name="page214"
       id="page214"></a>[pg 214]</span> With Russia was not likely
       to open up any large store of wheat or grain in the near
       future. Possibly there is no real incongruity. The grain may
       be there, but the Russians, greedy creatures, may be going
       to eat it themselves.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, March 10th</i>.&mdash;Even in the gloomy
    atmosphere of the Upper Chamber the subject of divorce lends
    itself to humour. Lord <span class="sc">Buckmaster</span>, who
    introduced a Bill founded on the recommendations of the Royal
    Commission, performed his task with due solemnity, but some of
    the noble Lords who opposed it were positively skittish. Lord
    <span class="sc">Braye</span>, for example, thought that, if
    the Bill passed, <i>Who's Who</i> would require a supplement
    entitled <i>Who's Who's Wife</i>; and Lord <span class=
    "sc">Phillimore</span> illustrated the effects of easy divorce
    by a story of a Swiss marriage in which the bride-elect was
    attended by four of the happy man's previous spouses. He also
    told another of an American judge who, having explained that in
    this department of his duties he was "very strict," added, "Of
    course I make no difficulty the first time, but if they come
    again within twelve months I want a good reason."</p>

    <p>Mr. <span class="sc">Hogge</span> led a vigorous attack on
    the Ministry of Transport, which he seemed to think had done
    very little for its money except to divert the omnibuses at
    Westminster and so make it more difficult for Members of
    Parliament to get to the House. Mr. <span class="sc">Kennedy
    Jones</span>, who was responsible for the innovation, rather
    hinted that in the case of some Members this might not be
    altogether an objection. The brunt of the defence fell upon Mr.
    <span class="sc">Neal</span>, owing to the regretted absence of
    his chief, who had been ordered away by his doctor for a
    much-needed holiday and was reported to be recruiting himself
    on the golf-links. If exercise is what he needs he could have
    got plenty of it in the House to-night. Thanks to a persistent
    minority, Members were kept tramping through the Lobbies for
    the best part of five hours, and did not complete the full
    round of eighteen divisions until 2.15 A.M.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, March 11th</i>.&mdash;Possibly the news of
    "direct action's" heavy cropper at the Trade Union Conference
    had reached the Front Bench before the <span class="sc">Prime
    Minister</span>, in reply to a question regarding the shortage
    of labour in the building trades, bluntly attributed it to the
    stringency of the Trade Union regulations. When Mr.
          <span class="sc">Adamson</span> attempted to shift the
          blame on to a Government Department Mr. <span class=
          "sc">Lloyd George</span> retorted that he would be
          perfectly ready to deal with any peccant official if the
          Labour Leader for his part would deal with the Trade
          Unions.</p>

    <p>General <span class="sc">Seely</span> repeated his familiar
    arguments in favour of an independent Air Ministry, and Mr.
    <span class="sc">Churchill</span> once more defended his
    position, urging that it was better for the Air Service to have
    half a Minister in the Cabinet than none at all. To a
    suggestion that the lives of the Armenians might have been
    saved if we had sent more aeroplanes to Asia Minor, Mr.
    <span class="sc">Churchill</span> replied that unfortunately
    the Armenian and Turkish populations were so intermingled that
    our bombs would be dropping indiscriminately, like the rain,
    "upon the just and unjust feller."</p>

    <p>THE CONSERVATISM OF THE LIBERAL PARTY.</p>

    <p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I know you
    take no sides in party politics, but I still think you would
    like to hear why it is that I have gone over to the Independent
    Liberals. No, it has nothing to do with Mr. <span class=
    "sc">Asquith's</span> triumphal procession and still less with
    the <span class="sc">Northcliffe</span> Press. The fact is that
    till quite recently I belonged to the true blue Tory
    school&mdash;was indeed probably the last survivor of the Old
    Guard&mdash;and I found myself out of touch with the
    progressive tendencies of modern Toryism, its deplorable way of
    moving with the times, its hopeless habit of discarding what it
    would call the old shibboleths when it wrongly imagined them to
    be outworn. My decision to leave a party that has long ceased
    to deserve its honoured name was immediately due to a Liberal
    Paper which editorially ridiculed the Liberty League, formed
    for the defeat of Bolshevist propaganda, and pooh-poohed the
    idea of the existence of dangerous Bolshevist elements in the
    country. This attitude attracted me enormously; for I recalled
    the standpoint of the same paper in the days before the
    War&mdash;how it ridiculed the alleged German menace and
    pooh-poohed the idea of the existence of hostile German
    elements in our midst. Here, I said, is the party for me; here
    is your authentic Bourbon spirit&mdash;the type that learns
    nothing and forgets nothing; that in the midst of a changing
    world remains immovable as a rock. Yes, Sir, for a Tory of the
    old school there is no place to-day except in the ranks of
    Liberalism.</p>

    <h2>RATES OF EXCHANGE.</h2>

    <p>Jones was reading his morning paper in the opposite corner
    seat with unusual attention, and he disregarded my
    greeting.</p>

    <p>"Why this absorption?" I inquired. "Usually you come to the
    station with a piece of toast behind one ear, fastening your
    boots as you run, and wake us all up with your first fine
    morning rapture."</p>

    <p>"I was just taking a look at the exchanges," he replied.
    "The mark's about the same price as fly-paper, and, judging by
    the news from New York, your chewing-gum is going to cost you
    more shortly. Do you know anything about the money market?"</p>

    <p>"I occasionally see it stated that 'money is plentiful' in
    it," I returned. "I should think it must be an ideal
    place."</p>

    <p>"The most gorgeous thing in the world is to make a bit on
    exchange," he said. "There's such a splendid feeling of not
    having earned it, you know."</p>

    <p>"I understand exactly," I replied. "Cox once credited me
    with an extra month's pay by mistake. But I didn't realise that
    you ever had to think about money matters after having run our
    Mess in France."</p>

    <p>He appeared to take no offence. His capacity for being
    insulted in that direction had probably been exhausted during
    the period in point.</p>

    <p>"I know quite a lot about exchange," he remarked with a
    reminiscent smile. "You remember that when I got pipped in
    France in '15, they sent me out next time to Salonica. I hadn't
    been there very long before the question of exchange cropped
    up. In the early days most of us had English money only, and
    the villagers used to rook us frightfully changing it. I
    remember sending my batman, MacGusgogh, to a place for eggs,
    and he came back with the change for my Bradbury in nickel. I
    had a good look at it, and on each coin was the mystic
    inscription, 'DIHAP,' which is pronounced 'dinar.'</p>

    <p>"'MacGusgogh,' I said, 'you pretend to be a Scotsman and yet
    you've been diddled. This is Serbian money, and not worth a
    bean.'</p>

    <p>"'Oh the deceitfu' deevils,' said he, 'there's neither truth
    nor honesty in the leein' buddies, Sir. But here's your
    Bradbury, an', at onny rate, we hae the eggs, Sir, for I paid
    for them wi' a label off yin o' they Japaneesy beer bottles. It
    seemed an awfu' waste to spend guid siller on folk that dinna
    ken when they see it.'"</p>

    <p>I began to see the possibilities of the money market.</p>

    <p>"I was round about there till the Armistice," Jones went on,
    "then I drifted by stages to South Russia. All the Eastern
    countries live by exchange. Practically the only trade they
    have is playing tennis with each others' currency, and the
    headquarters of the industry in 1918 was South Russia. I
    thought I'd seen the limit of low finance when I'd experienced
    the franc, lira, drachma, dinar, lev and piastre; but they were
    all child's play to the rouble in 1918."</p><span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="page217"
       id="page217"></a>[pg 217]</span>

    <p>"I thought Russian money was all dud before that," I
    remarked.</p>

    <p>"Not a bit of it," said Jones. "You see, it's not as if
    there were one breed, so to speak, of rouble. There were
    <span class="sc">Kerensky</span> roubles, and Duma roubles, and
    <span class="sc">Nicholas</span> roubles, and every little town
    had a rouble-works which was turning out local notes as hard as
    they, could go. I missed a fortune there by inches."</p>

    <p>"Tell me," I said, in response to his anecdotal eye.</p>

    <p>"I had a job there which consisted of going backwards and
    forwards on the railway between Otwiski and Triadropoldir in
    the Caucasus, a six days' trip. The possibilities of the
    situation never struck me till one day I, asked a shopman in
    Triadropoldir to give me my change in Otwiski
    roubles&mdash;both towns had their own currency, of course. He
    gave me five Otwiski roubles for one of his own town. I thought
    a bit about that, and when I got back to Otwiski I tried the
    same thing, and found I could get three Triadropoldir roubles
    there for one Otwiski."</p>

    <p>"I see," I remarked, as the beauty of this arrangement
    dawned upon me.</p>

    <p>"All I had to do therefore was to change my money in Otwiski
    for three times as much Triadropoldir currency, and then go up
    the line to the other place and change it back again, making
    fifteen hundred per cent, on the round trip. Of course you
    couldn't always change the full amount, but in a couple of
    months I had sixty thousand roubles&mdash;my valise was crammed
    with them&mdash;and I was only waiting to get down to the Field
    Cashier to change out and make my fortune."</p>

    <p>"And did you?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"No, I didn't. One morning the Reds arrived in
    Triadropoldir, and my servant and I only just got away with the
    valise on one of those inspection cars which you propel by
    pulling a handle backwards and forwards. A section of Red
    Cavalry came after us, and we took it in turns to work the
    handle."</p>

    <p>"Your servant won't ever be short of a job," I commented.
    "He ought to take to film-acting after that like a duck to
    water."</p>

    <p>"We soon finished my servant's ammunition and they were
    closing in on us fast. My hair had appreciably lifted my tin
    hat when I had a brain-wave and threw out a double handful of
    rouble notes. It worked like a charm; they all stopped to
    collect the money, and we had gone quite a distance before they
    caught us up again, I threw out more notes at intervals, and
    the last thousand roubles went just as we came in sight of
    <span class="sc">Denikin's</span> outposts fifteen miles down
    the line. We were saved, but I had lost my fortune, for there
    was no chance of repeating the operation."</p>

    <p>I sighed. Then, without any regard for the conclusions of my
    fellow-passengers, I silently raised both my hands above my
    head.</p>

    <h3>THE GREAT MUTTON CAMPAIGN.</h3>

    <p>The recent disclosures concerning the enormous stocks of
    frozen mutton held by the Ministry of Food&mdash;some of it
    killed two years ago&mdash;have put the Government on their
    mettle, and a vigorous campaign is now in preparation with the
    object of inducing the public to assist in the disposal of
    these overgrown supplies. Mr. Punch, being in touch with
    sources of information not accessible to the general Press, has
    been able to secure an advance copy of a popular appeal Which
    is about to be issued broadcast by the Government. It runs as
    follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Men, Women and Children of the United Kingdom!"</p>

    <p>"The time has now arrived when each one of you is privileged
    to illumine these drab days of peace with a show of patriotism
    no less brilliant than that which lit up the dark years of war.
    The task that is demanded is a simple one, and no heavy price
    is exacted; all that is required is a single-minded
    concentration upon the one essential need of the moment.</p>

    <p>"Your Government, solicitous as always for your welfare, has
    during the past two years accumulated a vast store of
    nutritious mutton to safeguard you against the peril of
    starvation. That danger being happily averted, it is now up to
    you to eat the stuff. This is not a problem that can be tackled
    by half-measures. If you desire to preserve the financial
    stability of the Empire, and if you do not wish to go on eating
    antiquated corpses of Australasian sheep for the rest of your
    lives, you must set your teeth in grim earnest, eating against
    time and chewing over time. You must consume mutton for
    breakfast, mutton for luncheon, mutton for tea and mutton for
    dinner. In fact, each one of you must in the interests of the
    State become a mutton glutton.</p>

    <p>"Do you shrink from the task? Do you shirk the chop now that
    you know what is at stake? An army marches on its stomach; the
    nation's well-being hangs on yours. Henceforth, until the
    'Cease Fire' sounds, you must fall upon the domestic enemy as
    our gallant soldiers fell upon the alien foe. No quarter must
    be given, no quarter, fore or hind, be permitted to escape.
    Beef must be banned and veal avoided as the plague; no Briton
    worthy of the name will claim a fowl.</p>

    <p>"What are you going to do about it? Do you intend (to borrow
    a Trans-atlantic phrase) to give the frozen mitt to the frozen
    mutt? Or are you going to take it to your bosom and give it
    there, or thereabouts, the home for which it has so long been
    vainly seeking?</p>

    <p>"Do it now and do it always. Let your daily motto
    be&mdash;'<i>Revenons à nos moutons</i>.'"</p>

    <p>In addition to the foregoing, every British housewife is to
    be supplied with a valuable booklet containing a number of
    official recipes for dealing with mutton. Among the tasty
    dishes thus described may be mentioned Whitehall Hash,
    Ministerial Mince, Reconstruction Rissoles, Control Cutlets and
    Separation Stew.</p>

    <p>Mr. Punch also learns that in honour of the campaign the
    Yeomen of the Guard are henceforth to be popularly known as the
    "Muttoneaters."</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned
    Clerks</i>.)</p>

    <p>During the past few years the plays and stories, especially
    the stories, of <span class="sc">Anton Tchehov</span> have so
    triumphantly captured English-speaking readers that there must
    be many who will welcome with eagerness the volume of his
    <i>Letters</i> (<span class="sc">Chatto and Windus</span>).
    This happy chance we owe, of course, directly to Mrs.
    <span class="sc">Constance Garnett</span>, who here proves once
    again that in her hands translation ranks as a fine art. Both
    the <i>Letters</i> and the Biographical Sketch that precedes
    them are of extraordinary charm and interest. Because
    <span class="sc">Tchehov's</span> stories are so conspicuously
    uncoloured by the personality of their writer (his method
    being, as it were, to lead the reader to a window of absolute
    transparency and bid him look for himself), it comes almost as
    a shock to find how vivid and many-hued that personality in
    fact was. Nor is it less astonishing to observe a nature so
    alive with sympathy expressing itself in an art so detached.
    More than once his letters to literary friends are concerned
    with a defence of this method: "Let the jury judge them; it's
    my job simply to show what sort of people they are." They are
    filled also with a thousand instances of the author's delight
    in nature, in country sights and scents, and of his love and
    understanding for animals (from which of the Tales is it that
    one recalls the dog being lifted into the cart "wearing a
    strained smile"?) Throughout too, if you have already read the
    eight little volumes that contain the stories&mdash;which I
    certainly advise as a preliminary&mdash;you will be continually
    experiencing the pleasure of recognising the inspiration for
    this or that remembered scene. In short, one of the most
    fascinating books that has come my way for a long time.</p>

    <p>I needn't pretend that <i>Bed and Black</i>
          (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>), by <span class=
          "sc">Grace S. Richmond</span>, is what is known to the
          superior as a serious work of art or that the men
          (particularly) of her creating are what would be called
          likely. But there's a sincerity about the writing which
          one has to respect. Of her two heroes, <i>Red</i> is
          <i>Redfield Pepper Burns</i>, the rude and rugged doctor,
          and <i>Black</i> is the <i>Rev. Robert McPherson
          Black</i>, the perfect paragon of a padre in an American
          provincial town. The author's main thesis is that padres
          are made of the right stuff. <i>Black</i>, who was all
          for getting into the War from the beginning, rushes off
          to Europe as chaplain with the first American drafts,
          gets wounded, decorated and married. The conversion of
          <i>Red Pepper</i>, the doctor, and of <i>Jane Ray</i>,
          who became <i>Mrs. Black</i>, is a little too easily
          contrived to be very convincing. But this is a simple
          work for simple souls who like a wholesome tale with a
          distinct list to the side of the angels. Such untoward
          conduct as here appears is not put in for its own
          interesting sake, but merely to bring out the
          white-souled nobility of the principals.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>If I had to select an author likely to win the long-distance
    dialogue race of the British Isles I should, after reading
    <i>Uncle Lionel</i> (<span class="sc">Grant Richards</span>),
    unhesitatingly vote for Mr. S.P.B. <span class=
    "sc">Mais</span>. It is not however so much the verbosity as
    the gloom of Mr. <span class="sc">Mais's</span> characters that
    leaves me fretful. Nowadays, when a novel begins with a married
    hero and heroine, we should be sadly archaic if we expected the
    course of their conjugal love to run smoothly; but I protest
    that <i>Michael</i> and <i>Patricia</i> overdid their quarrels,
    or, at any rate, that we are told too many details about them.
    And when these people were nasty to each other they could be
    very horrid. All which would not trouble me half
          <span class="pagenum"><a name="page220"
       id="page220"></a>[pg 220]</span> so much if I were not sure
       that Mr. <span class="sc">Mais</span>, in his desire to he
       forceful and modern, is inflicting a quite unnecessary
       handicap upon himself. At present he is in peril of wrecking
       his craft upon some dangerous rocks which (though I know
       it's not the right name for rocks) I will call "The
       Doldrums." My advice to him is to cheer up. And the sooner
       the better, for all of us.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There be novelists so fertile in literary resource or so
    catholic in their choice of subject that the reader is never
    sure, when he picks up their latest masterpiece, whether he is
    to have a comedy of manners, a proletarian tragedy, a tale of
    Court intrigue or a satire on the follies of the age. To the
    steady-going devotee of fiction&mdash;the reader on the Clapham
    omnibus&mdash;this versatility is a source of annoyance rather
    than of attraction, and I accordingly take pleasure in stating
    that by those who like a light narrative, in which mystery and
    romance are pleasingly blended, the author of <i>The Pointing
    Man</i> can be relied upon to rill the bill every time.
    Conformity to type is a strong point with this author as far as
    the mystery and romance are concerned, but within those limits
    he (or she) provides an admirable range of scene, character and
    plot. In <i>The Further Side of the Door</i>
          (<span class="sc">Hutchinson</span>), the once handsome
          and popular hero emerges from a war-hospital badly
          disfigured and is promptly jilted by his fiancée and
          avoided, or so he thinks, by his acquaintances. Disgusted
          he buries himself in an old haunted house in the wilds of
          Ireland and abandons himself to the practice of magic.
          The result is highly successful, for he raises, not a
          spirit indeed, but something much more desirable to a
          lonely young man who has been contemplating suicide. So
          much for the romance. The mystery is provided by a
          villain, an enterprising young married woman, and the
          sinister denizens of a creepy boarding-house. I heartily
          recommend <i>Punch</i> readers who like a mystery to buy
          the book and find out what happens.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The publishers of <i>Sir Limpidus</i> (<span class=
    "sc">Collins</span>) call it, in large print, a "new and
    amusing novel," but I am not confident about your subscription
    to the latter part of that statement; for Mr.
          <span class="sc">Marmaduke Pickthall's</span> irony is
          either so subtle or so heavy (I cannot be positive which)
          that one may well imagine a not too dull-witted reader
          going from end to end without discovering the hidden
          intent. The subject of the tale, which has no special
          plot, is a numbskull landowner, <i>Sir Limpidus</i>, son
          of <i>Sir Busticus</i>, lord of Clearfount Abbey, and
          type (according to Mr. <span class="sc">Pickthall</span>)
          of the landowning class that he evidently considers ripe
          for abolition. As propaganda to that end he conducts his
          hero through the usual career of the pre-war aristocrat,
          sending him to public school and Varsity (those
          sufficiently broad targets), giving him a marriage,
          strictly <i>de convenance</i>, with the daughter of a
          peer, and finishing him off as a member of the
          Government, alarmed at Socialist hecklers and welcoming
          the War as likely to give a new direction to forces that
          threaten to become too strong for his well-meaning
          incompetence. "It would rouse the ancient spirit of the
          people and dispel their madness.... Even defeat as a
          united nation would be better than ignoble peace with the
          anarchic mob supreme." Of course this may be highly
          amusing, but&mdash; The fact is that, with a
          disappointment the greater from having genial memories of
          a former book of his, I have to confess myself one of the
          dullards for whom Mr. <span class="sc">Pickthall's</span>
          satirical darts fall apparently pointless. I am
          sorry.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I am feeling a little peevish about <i>Ladies in Waiting</i>
    (<span class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</span>), because Miss
    <span class="sc">Kate Douglas Wiggin</span> has often charmed
    me by her writing in the past, and now she has disappointed me.
    Her latest book contains five stories, all nicely written and
    set in charming scenes; but their innocent sweetness is very
    nearly insipid, and the fact that Miss <span class=
    "sc">Wiggin's</span> only concern has been to find suitable
    husbands for her six heroines (there are two in one story)
    makes them curiously unexciting. Of course we all know that in
    American fiction the hero and heroine will in the end marry, to
    their mutual satisfaction; but unless the author can contrive
    <i>en route</i> a few obstacles which will intrigue the reader
    a marriage announcement in the newspapers would be more
    economical and quite as interesting. It is difficult to be
    "nice" and "funny," I know, and it was very noble of Miss
    <span class="sc">Wiggin</span> if one quality had to be left
    out to cling to the niceness; but I hope that in her next book
    she will manage to be both.</p>

    <p>While reading <i>With the Mad 17th to Italy</i>
          (<span class="sc">Allen and Unwin</span>) I could not
          help feeling sorry that the public's appetite for
          war-literature is reported to have become a little jaded
          for anything that is not a book of revelations; and this
          because Major B.H. <span class="sc">Hody</span>, who was
          in command of the 17th Divisional Supply Column,
          describes his trek from Flanders to Italy with uncommon
          zest. It is an admirable account of an achievement well
          worth recording, and the author in his advice to C.O.'s,
          which seems to me full of wisdom and sound common-sense,
          explains how it was that "the mad 17th" were from first
          to last "a happy family." There is cause for deep sorrow
          in the thought that Major <span class="sc">Hody</span>
          died suddenly at Cologne only a few weeks after his
          preface was finished. He has left behind him a book which
          will be valued not less for what it contains than for the
          sake of the man who wrote it.</p>

practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
